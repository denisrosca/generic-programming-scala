## What is generic programming?

"Generic programming is a type of polymorphism that your favorite language does not 
support yet." - Miles Sabin

The main idea behind it is to solve problems for a wide variety of types by writing 
a small amount of generic code. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
